It provides training and evaluation code for tasks and models that take arbitrary
chemical structures as input to predict energies / forces / positions, and can
be used as a base scaffold for research projects. For an overview of tasks, data, and metrics, please read our papers:

## Installation

See [installation instructions](https://github.com/Open-Catalyst-Project/ocp/blob/main/INSTALL.md).

## Download data

Dataset download links and instructions are in [DATASET.md](https://github.com/Open-Catalyst-Project/ocp/blob/main/DATASET.md).

## Train and evaluate models

A detailed description of how to train and evaluate models, run ML-based
relaxations, and generate EvalAI submission files can be found in
[TRAIN.md](https://github.com/Open-Catalyst-Project/ocp/blob/main/TRAIN.md).

Our evaluation server is [hosted on EvalAI](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/712/overview).
Numbers (in papers, etc.) should be reported from the evaluation server.

Interactive tutorial notebooks can be found
[here](https://github.com/Open-Catalyst-Project/ocp/tree/main/tutorials) to
get familiar with various components of the codebase.

## Pretrained model weights

We provide several pretrained model weights for download
[here](https://github.com/Open-Catalyst-Project/ocp/blob/main/MODELS.md).

## Discussion

For all non-codebase related questions and to keep up-to-date with the latest OCP
announcements, please join the [discussion board](https://discuss.opencatalystproject.org/).

All code-related questions and issues should be posted directly on our
[issues page](https://github.com/Open-Catalyst-Project/ocp/issues).
Make sure to first go through the [FAQ](https://github.com/Open-Catalyst-Project/ocp/tree/main/FAQ.md)
to check if your question's answered already.
