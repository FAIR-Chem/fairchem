Welcome to FAIRChem! (Under construction - 2024-05-06~2024-05-07)

(2024-05-06) Repository changes

To better test integration between our packages and keep them up to date we have migrated all existing repositories under Open-Catalyst-Project to a single repository (this one), FAIRChem. 

Our new structure supports the fairchem package namespace with several independently installable packages:
* [fairchem.core](src/fairchem/core) (formerly [OpenCatalystProject - OCP](https://github.com/Open-Catalyst-Project/ocp/tree/main))
* [fairchem.data.oc](src/fairchem/data/oc) (fomerly [Open-Catalyst-Dataset](https://github.com/Open-Catalyst-Project/Open-Catalyst-Dataset))
* [fairchem.data.om](src/fairchem/data/om) (formerly [om-data](https://github.com/Open-Catalyst-Project/om-data))
* [fairchem.data.odac](src/fairchem/data/odac) (formerly [odac-data](https://github.com/Open-Catalyst-Project/odac-data/tree/main))
* [fairchem.demo.ocpapi](src/fairchem/demo/ocpapi) (formerly [ocpapi](https://github.com/Open-Catalyst-Project/ocpapi))
* [fairchem.applications.adsorbml](src/fairchem/applications/AdsorbML) (formerly [AdsorbML](https://github.com/Open-Catalyst-Project/AdsorbML))
* [fairchem.applications.cattsunami](src/fairchem/applications/CatTSunami)
