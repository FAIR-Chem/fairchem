## File overview

These files have been processed so they are ready for direct use in modeling. As annotated in the file names, to match structures using the XRD data we used a max Rwp score of 40 and a minimum q-score of 70. These are the same as what was used for the publication
The files contain all data needed for modeling (i.e. aggregated computational descriptors and experimental data). All files were last updated with the 241113 experimental data.
Below is a table summarizing the file contents:

## File overview
