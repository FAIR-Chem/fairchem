    Modify or exclude files from download if running in a PyPi-installed

    Installation of FAIR-Chem with PyPi does not include the entire
    directory structure of the fairchem repo. As such, files outside of
    `src` can't be downloaded and those in `src` should actually be in the
    `site-packages` directory. If a user wants these files, they must
    build from the git repo.

    If the tests have been separately downloaded (e.g. from the git repo),
    then we can download if we've been told where those tests have been
    downloaded to. Note that we can't divine that location from anything
    in fairchem.core because they would have to be somewhere "unexpected"
    since we've built with PyPi which shouldn't have tests at all.
