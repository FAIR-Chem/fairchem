We use Jmol (https://jmol.sourceforge.net/) to identify the parallel benzene rings, metal-oxygen-metal bridges and uncoordinated nitrogen atoms which are expressed in SMARTS.
1. parallel benzene rings
We are considering benzene rings and 6-membered aromatic heterocyclic compounds. We observed that Jmol failed to identify aromatic bonds for a handful of cases, and we use a combination of SMARTS expressions to represent aromatic rings.
Three criterias have to be satisfied: 1. 2 rings are parallel; 2. the distance one atom from the first ring to the center of the other ring is between 4.5 and 9.5 Angstrom; 3. The distance between the planes where the rings are in are between 5.5 and 8.5 Angstrom
2. metal-oxygen-metal bridges: [$(select {metal})]~[$(select oxygen)]~[$(select {metal})]
3. uncoordinated nitrogen atoms: [$([#7X2r5])]

We recommend using the jmolData.jar for high-throughput calculations. jmol.jar, which takes more time to run, is good for visualization and debug.
Steps:
1. Change the content of 'list_MOF.txt' to the paths of the MOFs 
2. Use 'java  -jar JmolData.jar -on  -s features.txt' to run the script
3. The output will be saved in the 'output.txt' in the same directory by default, and it can be modified at the last line of the code.
	'output.txt' has 10 columns:
		1. ID is the index in 'list_MOF.txt'.
		2. Material is the name of the MOF (.cif stripped from the lines in 'list_MOF.txt').
		3. CF is the chemical formula.
		4. M_O_M is whether the MOF has metal-oxigen-metal bridges (0=No, 1=Yes).
		5. Benzene is whether the MOF has benzene rings or heterocyclic 6-membered rings.
		6. Parellel is whether the MOF has parallel rings. 
		7. Parellel68 is whether the distance between the planes where the rings are in is between 5.5 and 8.5 Angstrom.
		8. DistanceParallel68 is the distance of the planes between 5.5 and 8.5 Angstrom.
		9. DistanceParallel68Direct is the distance one atom from the first ring to the center of the other ring between 4.5 and 9.5 Angstrom.
		10. uncoordN is whether the MOF has uncoordinated N atoms.

In this repo, we provided the cif files of the example MOFs in Figure 3 and their outputs.
