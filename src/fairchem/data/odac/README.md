# ODAC23 Dataset

To download the ODAC23 dataset, please see the links [here](https://fair-chem.github.io/core/datasets/odac.html).

Pre-trained ML models and configs are available [here](https://fair-chem.github.io/core/model_checkpoints.html#open-direct-air-capture-2023-odac23).

This repository contains the list of [promising MOFs](https://github.com/FAIR-Chem/fairchem/tree/main/src/fairchem/data/odac/promising_mof) discovered in the ODAC23 paper, as well as details of the [classifical force field calculations](https://github.com/FAIR-Chem/fairchem/tree/main/src/fairchem/data/odac/force_field). 

Information about supercells can be found in [supercell_info.csv](https://github.com/FAIR-Chem/fairchem/blob/main/src/fairchem/data/odac/supercell_info.csv) for each example.
