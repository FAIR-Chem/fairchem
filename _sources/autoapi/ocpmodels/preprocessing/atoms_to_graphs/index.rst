   A class to help convert periodic atomic structures to graphs.

   The AtomsToGraphs class takes in periodic atomic structures in form of ASE atoms objects and converts
   them into graph representations for use in PyTorch. The primary purpose of this class is to determine the
   nearest neighbors within some radius around each individual atom, taking into account PBC, and set the
   pair index and distance between atom pairs appropriately. Lastly, atomic properties and the graph information
   are put into a PyTorch geometric data object for use with PyTorch.

   :param max_neigh: Maximum number of neighbors to consider.
   :type max_neigh: int
   :param radius: Cutoff radius in Angstroms to search for neighbors.
   :type radius: int or float
   :param r_energy: Return the energy with other properties. Default is False, so the energy will not be returned.
   :type r_energy: bool
   :param r_forces: Return the forces with other properties. Default is False, so the forces will not be returned.
   :type r_forces: bool
   :param r_stress: Return the stress with other properties. Default is False, so the stress will not be returned.
   :type r_stress: bool
   :param r_distances: Return the distances with other properties.
   :type r_distances: bool
   :param Default is False:
   :param so the distances will not be returned.:
   :param r_edges: Return interatomic edges with other properties. Default is True, so edges will be returned.
   :type r_edges: bool
   :param r_fixed: Return a binary vector with flags for fixed (1) vs free (0) atoms.
   :type r_fixed: bool
   :param Default is True:
   :param so the fixed indices will be returned.:
   :param r_pbc: Return the periodic boundary conditions with other properties.
   :type r_pbc: bool
   :param Default is False:
   :param so the periodic boundary conditions will not be returned.:
   :param r_data_keys: Return values corresponding to given keys in atoms.info data with other
   :type r_data_keys: sequence of str, optional
   :param properties. Default is None:
   :param so no data will be returned as properties.:
