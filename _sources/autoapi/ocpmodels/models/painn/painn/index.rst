.. py:class:: PaiNN(num_atoms: int, bond_feat_dim: int, num_targets: int, hidden_channels: int = 512, num_layers: int = 6, num_rbf: int = 128, cutoff: float = 12.0, max_neighbors: int = 50, rbf: Dict[str, str] = {'name': 'gaussian'}, envelope: Dict[str, Union[str, int]] = {'name': 'polynomial', 'exponent': 5}, regress_forces: bool = True, direct_forces: bool = True, use_pbc: bool = True, otf_graph: bool = True, num_elements: int = 83, scale_file: Optional[str] = None)


   Bases: :py:obj:`ocpmodels.models.base.BaseModel`

   PaiNN model based on the description in SchÃ¼tt et al. (2021):
   Equivariant message passing for the prediction of tensorial properties
   and molecular spectra, https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03150.

   .. py:property:: num_params

   .. py:method:: select_symmetric_edges(tensor, mask, reorder_idx, inverse_neg) -> torch.Tensor


   .. py:method:: symmetrize_edges(edge_index, cell_offsets, neighbors, batch_idx, reorder_tensors, reorder_tensors_invneg)

      Symmetrize edges to ensure existence of counter-directional edges.

      Some edges are only present in one direction in the data,
      since every atom has a maximum number of neighbors.
      If `symmetric_edge_symmetrization` is False,
      we only use i->j edges here. So we lose some j->i edges
      and add others by making it symmetric.
      If `symmetric_edge_symmetrization` is True,
      we always use both directions.

.. py:class:: PaiNNMessage(hidden_channels, num_rbf)


   Bases: :py:obj:`torch_geometric.nn.MessagePassing`

   Base class for creating message passing layers.

   Message passing layers follow the form

   .. math::
       \mathbf{x}_i^{\prime} = \gamma_{\mathbf{\Theta}} \left( \mathbf{x}_i,
       \bigoplus_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} \, \phi_{\mathbf{\Theta}}
       \left(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{x}_j,\mathbf{e}_{j,i}\right) \right),

   where :math:`\bigoplus` denotes a differentiable, permutation invariant
   function, *e.g.*, sum, mean, min, max or mul, and
   :math:`\gamma_{\mathbf{\Theta}}` and :math:`\phi_{\mathbf{\Theta}}` denote
   differentiable functions such as MLPs.
   See `here <https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/
   create_gnn.html>`__ for the accompanying tutorial.

   :param aggr: The aggregation scheme
                to use, *e.g.*, :obj:`"sum"` :obj:`"mean"`, :obj:`"min"`,
                :obj:`"max"` or :obj:`"mul"`.
                In addition, can be any
                :class:`~torch_geometric.nn.aggr.Aggregation` module (or any string
                that automatically resolves to it).
                If given as a list, will make use of multiple aggregations in which
                different outputs will get concatenated in the last dimension.
                If set to :obj:`None`, the :class:`MessagePassing` instantiation is
                expected to implement its own aggregation logic via
                :meth:`aggregate`. (default: :obj:`"add"`)
   :type aggr: str or [str] or Aggregation, optional
   :param aggr_kwargs: Arguments passed to the
                       respective aggregation function in case it gets automatically
                       resolved. (default: :obj:`None`)
   :type aggr_kwargs: Dict[str, Any], optional
   :param flow: The flow direction of message passing
                (:obj:`"source_to_target"` or :obj:`"target_to_source"`).
                (default: :obj:`"source_to_target"`)
   :type flow: str, optional
   :param node_dim: The axis along which to propagate.
                    (default: :obj:`-2`)
   :type node_dim: int, optional
   :param decomposed_layers: The number of feature decomposition
                             layers, as introduced in the `"Optimizing Memory Efficiency of
                             Graph Neural Networks on Edge Computing Platforms"
                             <https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03058>`_ paper.
                             Feature decomposition reduces the peak memory usage by slicing
                             the feature dimensions into separated feature decomposition layers
                             during GNN aggregation.
                             This method can accelerate GNN execution on CPU-based platforms
                             (*e.g.*, 2-3x speedup on the
                             :class:`~torch_geometric.datasets.Reddit` dataset) for common GNN
                             models such as :class:`~torch_geometric.nn.models.GCN`,
                             :class:`~torch_geometric.nn.models.GraphSAGE`,
                             :class:`~torch_geometric.nn.models.GIN`, etc.
                             However, this method is not applicable to all GNN operators
                             available, in particular for operators in which message computation
                             can not easily be decomposed, *e.g.* in attention-based GNNs.
                             The selection of the optimal value of :obj:`decomposed_layers`
                             depends both on the specific graph dataset and available hardware
                             resources.
                             A value of :obj:`2` is suitable in most cases.
                             Although the peak memory usage is directly associated with the
                             granularity of feature decomposition, the same is not necessarily
                             true for execution speedups. (default: :obj:`1`)
   :type decomposed_layers: int, optional

   .. py:method:: reset_parameters() -> None

      Resets all learnable parameters of the module.


   .. py:method:: forward(x, vec, edge_index, edge_rbf, edge_vector)

      Runs the forward pass of the module.


   .. py:method:: message(xh_j, vec_j, rbfh_ij, r_ij)

      Constructs messages from node :math:`j` to node :math:`i`
      in analogy to :math:`\phi_{\mathbf{\Theta}}` for each edge in
      :obj:`edge_index`.
      This function can take any argument as input which was initially
      passed to :meth:`propagate`.
      Furthermore, tensors passed to :meth:`propagate` can be mapped to the
      respective nodes :math:`i` and :math:`j` by appending :obj:`_i` or
      :obj:`_j` to the variable name, *.e.g.* :obj:`x_i` and :obj:`x_j`.


   .. py:method:: aggregate(features: Tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor], index: torch.Tensor, ptr: Optional[torch.Tensor], dim_size: Optional[int]) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]

      Aggregates messages from neighbors as
      :math:`\bigoplus_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)}`.

      Takes in the output of message computation as first argument and any
      argument which was initially passed to :meth:`propagate`.

      By default, this function will delegate its call to the underlying
      :class:`~torch_geometric.nn.aggr.Aggregation` module to reduce messages
      as specified in :meth:`__init__` by the :obj:`aggr` argument.


   .. py:method:: update(inputs: Tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]

      Updates node embeddings in analogy to
      :math:`\gamma_{\mathbf{\Theta}}` for each node
      :math:`i \in \mathcal{V}`.
      Takes in the output of aggregation as first argument and any argument
      which was initially passed to :meth:`propagate`.



.. py:class:: PaiNNUpdate(hidden_channels)


   Bases: :py:obj:`torch.nn.Module`

   Base class for all neural network modules.

   Your models should also subclass this class.

   Modules can also contain other Modules, allowing to nest them in
   a tree structure. You can assign the submodules as regular attributes::

       import torch.nn as nn
       import torch.nn.functional as F

       class Model(nn.Module):
           def __init__(self):
               super().__init__()
               self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 20, 5)
               self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(20, 20, 5)

           def forward(self, x):
               x = F.relu(self.conv1(x))
               return F.relu(self.conv2(x))

   Submodules assigned in this way will be registered, and will have their
   parameters converted too when you call :meth:`to`, etc.

   .. note::
       As per the example above, an ``__init__()`` call to the parent class
       must be made before assignment on the child.

   :ivar training: Boolean represents whether this module is in training or
                   evaluation mode.
   :vartype training: bool
