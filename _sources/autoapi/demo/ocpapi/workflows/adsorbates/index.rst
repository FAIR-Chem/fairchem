   :async:

   Search for adsorbate binding sites on surfaces of a bulk material.

   :param adslab_filter: A function that modifies the set of adsorbate/slab

                         slabs and/or adsorbate configurations.
   :param client: The OCP API client to use.
   :param lifetime: Whether relaxations should be saved on the server, be marked
