.. py:exception:: RequestException(method: str, url: str, cause: str)

   Bases: :py:obj:`Exception`


   Exception raised any time there is an error while making an API call.

      :async:


      Starts relaxations of the input adsorbate configurations on the input
      slab using energies and forces returned by the input model. Relaxations
      are run asynchronously and results can be fetched using the system id
      that is returned from this method.

      :param adsorbate: Description of the adsorbate being simulated.
      :param adsorbate_configs: List of adsorbate configurations to relax. This
                                should only include the adsorbates themselves; the surface is
                                defined in the "slab" field that is a peer to this one.
