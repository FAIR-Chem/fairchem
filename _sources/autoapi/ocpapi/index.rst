   Exception raised when a model is not supported in the API.


.. py:function:: find_adsorbate_binding_sites(adsorbate: str, bulk: str, model: str = 'equiformer_v2_31M_s2ef_all_md', adslab_filter: Callable[[List[fairchem.demo.ocpapi.client.AdsorbateSlabConfigs]], Awaitable[List[fairchem.demo.ocpapi.client.AdsorbateSlabConfigs]]] = _DEFAULT_ADSLAB_FILTER, client: fairchem.demo.ocpapi.client.Client = DEFAULT_CLIENT, lifetime: Lifetime = Lifetime.SAVE) -> AdsorbateBindingSites
   :async:


   Search for adsorbate binding sites on surfaces of a bulk material.
   This executes the following steps:

       1. Ensure that both the adsorbate and bulk are supported in the
          OCP API.
       2. Enumerate unique surfaces from the bulk material.
       3. Enumerate likely binding sites for the input adsorbate on each
          of the generated surfaces.
       4. Filter the list of generated adsorbate/slab (adslab) configurations
           using the input adslab_filter.
       5. Relax each generated surface+adsorbate structure by refining
          atomic positions to minimize forces generated by the input model.

   :param adsorbate: Description of the adsorbate to place.
   :param bulk: The ID (typically Materials Project MP ID) of the bulk material
                on which the adsorbate will be placed.
   :param model: The type of the model to use when calculating forces during
                 relaxations.
   :param adslab_filter: A function that modifies the set of adsorbate/slab
                         configurations that will be relaxed. This can be used to subselect
                         slabs and/or adsorbate configurations.
   :param client: The OCP API client to use.
   :param lifetime: Whether relaxations should be saved on the server, be marked
                    as ephemeral (allowing them to deleted in the future), or deleted
                    immediately.

   :returns: Details of each adsorbate binding site, including results of relaxing
             to locally-optimized positions using the input model.

   :raises UnsupportedModelException: If the requested model is not supported.
   :raises UnsupportedBulkException: If the requested bulk is not supported.
   :raises UnsupportedAdsorbateException: If the requested adsorbate is not
       supported.

   :async:


   Wrapper around Client.get_adsorbate_slab_relaxations_results() that
   handles retries, including re-fetching individual configurations that
   are initially omitted.

   :param client: The client to use when making API calls.
   :param system_id: The system ID of the relaxations.
   :param config_ids: If defined and not empty, a subset of configurations
                      to fetch. Otherwise all configurations are returned.
   :param fields: If defined and not empty, a subset of fields in each
                  configuration to fetch. Otherwise all fields are returned.

   :returns: List of relaxation results, one for each adsorbate configuration in
             the system.


.. py:function:: wait_for_adsorbate_slab_relaxations(system_id: str, check_immediately: bool = False, slow_interval_sec: float = 30, fast_interval_sec: float = 10, pbar: Optional[tqdm.tqdm] = None, client: fairchem.demo.ocpapi.client.Client = DEFAULT_CLIENT) -> Dict[int, fairchem.demo.ocpapi.client.Status]
   :async:


   Blocks until all relaxations in the input system have finished, whether
   successfully or not.

   Relaxations are queued in the API, waiting until machines are ready to
   run them. Once started, they can take 1-2 minutes to finish. This method
   initially sleeps "slow_interval_sec" seconds between each check for any
   relaxations having finished. Once at least one result is ready, subsequent
   sleeps are for "fast_interval_sec" seconds.

   :param system_id: The ID of the system for which relaxations are running.
   :param check_immediately: If False (default), sleep before the first check
                             for relaxations having finished. If True, check whether relaxations
                             have finished immediately on entering this function.
   :param slow_interval_sec: The number of seconds to wait between each check
                             while all are still running.
   :param fast_interval_sec: The number of seconds to wait between each check
                             when at least one relaxation has finished in the system.
   :param pbar: A tqdm instance that tracks the number of configurations that
                have finished. This will be updated with the number of individual
                configurations whose relaxations have finished.
   :param client: The client to use when making API calls.

   :returns: Map of config IDs in the system to their terminal status.

      :staticmethod:


      Generates a sort key from the input adslab. Returns the miller indices,
      shift, and top/bottom label so that they will be sorted by those values
      in that order.

                          added to wait times. The default value is sensible; this is exposed
