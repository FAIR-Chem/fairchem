   Initializes an adsorbate object in one of 4 ways:
   - Directly pass in an ase.Atoms object.
       For this, you should also provide the index of the binding atom.
   - Pass in index of adsorbate to select from adsorbate database.
   - Pass in the SMILES string of the adsorbate to select from the database.
   - Randomly sample an adsorbate from the adsorbate database.

   :param adsorbate_atoms: Adsorbate structure.

      after the first revision are conditionally added for backwards
      compatibility with older database files.



.. py:class:: AdsorbateSlabConfig(slab: fairchem.data.oc.core.slab.Slab, adsorbate: fairchem.data.oc.core.slab.Adsorbate, num_sites: int = 100, num_augmentations_per_site: int = 1, interstitial_gap: float = 0.1, mode: str = 'random')

   Initializes a list of adsorbate-catalyst systems for a given Adsorbate and Slab.

   :param slab: Slab object.
   :type slab: Slab
   :param adsorbate: Adsorbate object.
   :type adsorbate: Adsorbate
   :param num_sites: Number of sites to sample.
   :type num_sites: int
   :param num_augmentations_per_site: Number of augmentations of the adsorbate per site. Total number of
                                      generated structures will be `num_sites` * `num_augmentations_per_site`.
   :type num_augmentations_per_site: int
   :param interstitial_gap: Minimum distance in Angstroms between adsorbate and slab atoms.
   :type interstitial_gap: float
   :param mode: "random", "heuristic", or "random_site_heuristic_placement".
                This affects surface site sampling and adsorbate placement on each site.

                In "random", we do a Delaunay triangulation of the surface atoms, then
                sample sites uniformly at random within each triangle. When placing the
                adsorbate, we randomly rotate it along xyz, and place it such that the
                center of mass is at the site.

                In "heuristic", we use Pymatgen's AdsorbateSiteFinder to find the most
                energetically favorable sites, i.e., ontop, bridge, or hollow sites.
                When placing the adsorbate, we randomly rotate it along z with only
                slight rotation along x and y, and place it such that the binding atom
                is at the site.

                In "random_site_heuristic_placement", we do a Delaunay triangulation of
                the surface atoms, then sample sites uniformly at random within each
                triangle. When placing the adsorbate, we randomly rotate it along z with
                only slight rotation along x and y, and place it such that the binding
                atom is at the site.

                In all cases, the adsorbate is placed at the closest position of no
                overlap with the slab plus `interstitial_gap` along the surface normal.

      Returns up to `num_sites` sites given the surface atoms' positions.



   .. py:method:: place_adsorbate_on_site(adsorbate: fairchem.data.oc.core.slab.Adsorbate, site: numpy.ndarray, interstitial_gap: float = 0.1)

      Place the adsorbate at the given binding site.



   .. py:method:: place_adsorbate_on_sites(sites: list, num_augmentations_per_site: int = 1, interstitial_gap: float = 0.1)

   .. py:method:: _get_scaled_normal(adsorbate_c: ase.Atoms, slab_c: ase.Atoms, site: numpy.ndarray, unit_normal: numpy.ndarray, interstitial_gap: float = 0.1)

      Get the scaled normal that gives a proximate configuration without atomic
      overlap by:
          1. Projecting the adsorbate and surface atoms onto the surface plane.
          2. Identify all adsorbate atom - surface atom combinations for which
              an itersection when translating along the normal would occur.
              This is where the distance between the projected points is less than
              r_surface_atom + r_adsorbate_atom
          3. Explicitly solve for the scaled normal at which the distance between
              surface atom and adsorbate atom = r_surface_atom + r_adsorbate_atom +
              interstitial_gap. This exploits the superposition of vectors and the
              distance formula, so it requires root finding.

      Assumes that the adsorbate's binding atom or center-of-mass (depending
      on mode) is already placed at the site.

   Class to represent a slab with multiple adsorbates on it. This class only

      Place the adsorbate at the given binding sites.

      This method generates a fixed number of configurations where sites are
      selected to ensure that adsorbate binding indices are at least a fair
      distance away from each other (covalent radii + interstitial gap).

.. py:class:: Solvent(solvent_atoms: ase.Atoms = None, solvent_id_from_db: int | None = None, solvent_db_path: str | None = SOLVENT_PKL_PATH, solvent_density: float | None = None)

   Initializes a solvent object in one of 2 ways:
   - Directly pass in an ase.Atoms object.
   - Pass in index of solvent to select from solvent database.

   :param solvent_atoms: Solvent molecule
   :type solvent_atoms: ase.Atoms
   :param solvent_id_from_db: Index of solvent to select.
   :type solvent_id_from_db: int
   :param solvent_db_path: Path to solvent database.
   :type solvent_db_path: str
   :param solvent_density: Desired solvent density to use. If not specified, the default is used
                           from the solvent databases.
   :type solvent_density: float

   .. py:method:: _load_solvent(solvent: dict) -> None

      Saves the fields from an adsorbate stored in a database. Fields added
      after the first revision are conditionally added for backwards
      compatibility with older database files.



   .. py:property:: molecules_per_volume
      Convert the solvent density in g/cm3 to the number of molecules per
      angstrom cubed of volume.
