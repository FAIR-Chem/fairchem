To run the Spherical Channel Network (SCN), install [e3nn](https://github.com/e3nn/e3nn/) with `pip install e3nn==0.2.6`.

SCN was developed with e3nn v0.2.6, and might run slower with later versions [[1](https://github.com/Open-Catalyst-Project/ocp/issues/397), [2](https://github.com/Open-Catalyst-Project/ocp/pull/402)].
