Training and Evaluating Models
==============================

The open compute challenge consists of three distinct tasks. This document is a tutorial
for training and evaluating models for each of these tasks as well as generating submission files for EvalAI.

:obj:`main.py` serves as the entry point to run any task tasks. This script requires two command line
arguments at a minimum:

* :obj:`--mode MODE`: MODE can be :obj:`train`, :obj:`predict` or :obj:`run-relaxations` to train a model, make predictions using an existing model, or run machine learning based relaxations using an existing model respectively.

* :obj:`--config-yml PATH`: PATH is the path to a YAML configuration file. We use YAML files to supply all parameters to the script. The :obj:`configs` directory contains a number of example config files.

Running :obj:`main.py` directly runs the model on a single CPU or GPU if one is available:

.. code-block:: sh

    python main.py --mode train --config-yml configs/TASK/MODEL.yml

If you have multiple GPUs, you can use distributed data parallel training by running:

.. code-block:: sh

    python -u -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=8 main.py --distributed --num-gpus 8 [...]

:obj:`torch.distributed.launch` launches multiple processes for distributed training. For more details, refer to
https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.html#launch-utility

If you have access to a slurm cluster, we use the :obj:`submitit` package to simplify multi-node distributed training:

.. code-block:: sh

    python main.py --distributed --num-gpus 8 --num-nodes 6 --submit [...]

In the rest of this tutorial, we explain how to train models for each task.

Initial Structure to Relaxed Energy prediction (IS2RE)
******************************************************

In the IS2RE tasks, the model takes the initial structure as input and predict the structureâ€™s energy
in the relaxed state. To train a model for the IS2RE task, you can use the :obj:`EnergyTrainer`
Trainer and :obj:`SinglePointLmdb` dataset by specifying the following in your configuration file:

.. code-block:: yaml

    trainer: energy # Use the EnergyTrainer

    dataset:
      # Train data
      - src: [Path to training data]
        normalize_labels: True
        # Mean and standard deviation of energies
        target_mean: -0.969171404838562
        target_std: 1.3671793937683105
      # Val data (optional)
      - src: [Path to validation data]
      # Test data (optional)
      - src: [Path to test data]

You can find examples configuration files in :obj:`configs/ocp_is2re`.

To train a SchNet model for the IS2RE task, run:

.. code-block:: sh

    python main.py --mode train --config-yml configs/ocp_is2re/schnet.yml


Training logs are stored in :obj:`logs/tensorboard/[TIMESTAMP]` where :obj:`[TIMESTAMP]` is
the starting time stamp of the run. You can monitor the training process by running:

.. code-block:: sh

    tensorboard --logdir logs/tensorboard/[TIMESTAMP]

At the end of training, the model checkpoint is stored in :obj:`checkpoints/[TIMESTAMP]/checkpoint.pt`.

Next, run this model on the test data:

.. code-block:: sh

    python main.py --mode predict --config-yml configs/ocp_is2re/schnet.yml \
            --checkpoint checkpoints/[TIMESTAMP]/checkpoint.pt

The predictions are stored in :obj:`predictions.json` and later used to create a submission file to be uploaded to EvalAI.

Structure to Energy and Forces (S2EF)
*************************************

In the S2EF task, the model takes the positions of the atoms as input and predicts the energy and per-atom
forces as calculated by DFT. To train a model for the S2EF task, you can use the :obj:`ForcesTrainer` Trainer
and :obj:`TrajectoryLmdb` dataset by specifying the following in your configuration file:

.. code-block:: yaml

    trainer: forces  # Use the ForcesTrainer

    dataset:
      # Training data
      - src: [Path to training data]
        normalize_labels: True
        # Mean and standard deviation of energies
        target_mean: -0.7586356401443481
        target_std: 2.981738567352295
        # Mean and standard deviation of forces
        grad_target_mean: 0.0
        grad_target_std: 2.981738567352295
      # Val data (optional)
      - src: [Path to validation data]
      # Test data (optional)
      - src: [Path to test data]

You can find examples configuration files in :obj:`configs/ocp_s2ef`.

To train a SchNet model for the S2EF task, run:

.. code-block:: sh

    python -u -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=2 main.py \
            --mode train --config-yml configs/ocp_s2ef/schnet.yml --num-gpus 2 --distributed

Similar to the IS2RE task, tensorboard logs are stored in :obj:`logs/tensorboard/[TIMESTAMP]` and the
checkpoint is stored in :obj:`checkpoints/[TIMESTAMP]/checkpoint.pt`.

Next, run this model on the test data:

.. code-block:: sh

    python main.py --mode predict --config-yml configs/ocp_s2ef/schnet.yml \
            --checkpoint checkpoints/[TIMESTAMP]/checkpoint.pt

The predictions are stored in :obj:`predictions.json` and later used to create a submission file to be uploaded to EvalAI.

Initial Structure to Relaxed Structure (IS2RS)
**********************************************

In the IS2RS task the model takes as input an initial structure and predicts the atomic positions in their
final, relaxed state. This can be done by training a model to predict per-atom forces similar to the S2EF
task and then running an iterative relaxation. Although we present an iterative approach, models that directly predict relaxed states are also possible. You can find example configuration files in `configs/ocp_is2rs`.

To train a SchNet model for the IS2RS task, run:

.. code-block:: sh

    python main.py --mode train --config-yml configs/ocp_is2rs/schnet.yml

Note -  iterative approaches to the IS2RS task use trained models that are no different than the S2EF task. Existing S2EF models may be used with the following additions to the configuration file:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Relaxation options
    relax_dataset:
      src: data/09_29_val_is2rs_lmdb
    write_pos: True
    relaxation_steps: 300
    relax_opt:
      maxstep: 300
      memory: 100
      damping: 0.25
      alpha: 100.
      traj_dir: "trajectories"  # Where to save the trajectories

After training, you can generate trajectories using:

.. code-block:: sh

    python main.py --mode run-relaxations --config-yml configs/ocp_is2rs/schnet.yml \
            --checkpoint checkpoints/[TIMESTAMP]/checkpoint.pt

The relaxed structure positions are stored in :obj:`[RESULTS_DIR]/relaxed_pos_[DEVICE #].json` and later used to create a submission file to be uploaded to EvalAI. Predicted trajectories are stored in :obj:`trajectories` directory for those interested in analyzing the complete relaxation trajectory.
