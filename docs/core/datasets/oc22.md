### Structure to Total Energy and Forces (S2EF-Total) task

For this taskâ€™s train, validation and test sets, we provide precomputed LMDBs that can be directly used with dataloaders provided in our code. The LMDBs contain input structures from all points in relaxation trajectories along with the energy of the structure and the atomic forces. The validation and test datasets are broken into subsplits based on in-distribution and out-of-distribution materials relative to the training dataset. All LMDBs are compressed into a single `.tar.gz` file.

### Initial Structure to Relaxed Structure (IS2RS) and Initial Structure to Relaxed Total Energy (IS2RE-Total) tasks

For IS2RE-Total / IS2RS training, validation and test sets, we provide precomputed LMDBs that can be directly used with dataloaders provided in our code. The LMDBs contain input initial structures and the output relaxed structures and energies. The validation and test datasets are broken into subsplits based on in-distribution and out-of-distribution materials relative to the training dataset. All LMDBs are compressed into a single `.tar.gz` file.

### Relaxation Trajectories

#### System trajectories (optional download)


We provide relaxation trajectories for all systems used in train and validation sets of S2EF-Total and IS2RE-Total/RS task:

### OC22 Mappings

#### Data mapping information



We provide a Python pickle file containing information about the slab and adsorbates for each of the systems in OC22 dataset. Loading the pickle file will load a Python dictionary. The keys of this dictionary are the system-ids (of the format `XYZ`  where `XYZ` is an integer, corresponding to the `sid` in the LMDB Data object), and the corresponding value of each key is a dictionary with information about:


* `bulk_id`: Materials Project ID of the bulk system used corresponding the the catalyst surface
* `bulk_symbols`: Chemical composition of the bulk counterpart
* `miller_index`: 3-tuple of integers indicating the Miller indices of the surface
* `traj_id`: Identifier associated with the accompanying raw trajectory (if available)
* `slab_sid`: Identifier associated with the corresponding slab (if available)
* `ads_symbols`: Chemical composition of the adsorbate counterpart (adosrbate+slabs only)
* `nads`: Number of adsorbates present

An example adsorbate+slab entry:

```
 6877: {'bulk_id': 'mp-559112',
  'miller_index': (1, 0, 0),
  'nads': 1,
  'traj_id': 'K2Zn6O7_mp-559112_RyQXa0N0uc_ohyUKozY3G',
  'bulk_symbols': 'K4Zn12O14',
  'slab_sid': 30859,
  'ads_symbols': 'O2'},
```

An example slab entry:

```
 34815: {'bulk_id': 'mp-18793',
  'miller_index': (1, 2, 1),
  'nads': 0,
  'traj_id': 'LiCrO2_mp-18793_clean_3HDHBg6TIz',
  'bulk_symbols': 'Li2Cr2O4'},
```

#### OC20 reference information


In order to train models on OC20 total energy, we provide a Python pickle file containing the energy necessary to convert adsorption energy values to total energy. Loading the pickle file will load a Python dictionary. The keys of this dictionary are the system-ids (of the format `random<XYZ>`  where `XYZ` is an integer, corresponding to the `sid` in the LMDB Data object), and the corresponding value of each key is the energy to be added to OC20 energy values. To train on total energies for OC20, specify the path to this pickle file in your training configs.
