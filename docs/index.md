#### FAIR-Chem overview

`fairchem` is the [FAIR](https://ai.meta.com/research/) Chemistry's centralized repository of all its data, models, demos, and application efforts
for materials science and quantum chemistry. Collaborative projects that contribute or use the models and approaches in
this repo:
* [Open Catalyst Project (OCP)](https://opencatalystproject.org/)
* [Open Direct Air Capture (OpenDAC)](https://open-dac.github.io/)

```{note}
We re-organized and rebranded the repository in 2024 (previously the `fairchem` repo) to reflect the increasingly
general usability of these models beyond catalysis, including things like direct air capture.
```

#### Datasets in `fairchem`:
`fairchem` provides training and evaluation code for tasks and models that take arbitrary
chemical structures as input to predict energies / forces / positions / stresses,
and can be used as a base scaffold for research projects. For an overview of
tasks, data, and metrics, please read the documentations and respective papers:
 - [OC20](core/datasets/oc20)
 - [OC22](core/datasets/oc22)
 - [ODAC23](core/datasets/odac)
 - [OC20Dense](core/datasets/oc20dense)
 - [OC20NEB](core/datasets/oc20neb)

### Discussion

For all non-codebase related questions and to keep up-to-date with the latest OCP
announcements, please join the [discussion board](https://discuss.opencatalystproject.org/).

All code-related questions and issues should be posted directly on our
[issues page](https://github.com/FAIR-Chem/fairchem/issues).

### Acknowledgements

- This codebase was initially forked from [CGCNN](https://github.com/txie-93/cgcnn)
by [Tian Xie](http://txie.me), but has undergone significant changes since.
- A lot of engineering ideas have been borrowed from [github.com/facebookresearch/mmf](https://github.com/facebookresearch/mmf).
- The DimeNet++ implementation is based on the [author's Tensorflow implementation](https://github.com/klicperajo/dimenet) and the [DimeNet implementation in Pytorch Geometric](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric/blob/master/torch_geometric/nn/models/dimenet.py).
- It was then developed as the OCP repo, and includes many contributions from the community and collaborators.
- Much of the documentation was developed for various papers or as part of a comprehensive tutorial for the 2023 ACS Fall Chemistry conference.
