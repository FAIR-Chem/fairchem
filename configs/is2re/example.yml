  #
  # Note that if task.primary_metric specified earlier in the config is a metric
  # where higher is better (e.g. 'energy_force_within_threshold' or
  # 'average_distance_within_threshold'), `mode` should be 'max' since we'd want
  # to step LR when the metric has stopped increasing. Vice versa for energy_mae
  # or forces_mae or loss.
  #
  # If you don't want to use a scheduler, set it to 'Null' (yes type that out).
  # This is for legacy reasons. If scheduler is unspecified, it defaults to
  # 'LambdaLR': warming up the learning rate to 'lr_initial' and then stepping
  # it at pre-defined set of steps. See the DimeNet++ config for how to do this.
